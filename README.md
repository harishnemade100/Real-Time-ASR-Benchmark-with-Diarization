# Real-Time-ASR-Benchmark-with-Diarization
Real-time ASR benchmarking project that streams a podcast and compares two providers (Deepgram &amp; AssemblyAI) on accuracy, latency, features, and cost. The script prints live diarized transcripts and logs metrics to a CSV. Includes a simple design for adding speaker identification on top of diarization.
